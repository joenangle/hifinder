## Why We Made This Change

### eBay API License Violations
The eBay API License Agreement prohibits:
1. ✗ Using eBay data to compete with eBay Services
2. ✗ Displaying eBay listings alongside competitor sources
3. ✗ Using eBay data for price modeling/comparison
4. ✗ Storing/redistributing eBay listing data

HiFinder violated **all four** of these by:
- Showing eBay listings next to Reddit/Head-Fi
- Calculating price variance and "Great Deal" badges
- Storing eBay data in our database
- Competing as a used marketplace aggregator

### Legal Alternative: Affiliate Program
eBay Partner Network allows:
- ✅ Linking to eBay search results
- ✅ Earning 4-8% commission on sales
- ✅ No data storage/display restrictions
- ✅ Full compliance with TOS

## Current Data Architecture

### Active Sources for Price Trends
```javascript
const ALLOWED_SOURCES = [
  'reddit_avexchange',  // ✅ Public forum data
  'head_fi',            // ✅ Public forum data
  'reverb',             // ✅ API (if we get key)
  'manual'              // ✅ Curated listings
];
```

### Data Flow
```
Reddit listings → Database → Calculate trends ✅
Head-Fi listings → Database → Calculate trends ✅
Manual listings → Database → Calculate trends ✅
eBay → Affiliate link only → Earn commission ✅
```
