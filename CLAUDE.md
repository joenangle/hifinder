## To-Do: Revisit Later
- üîÑ **Usage-to-sound-signature mappings**: Current auto-mappings (music‚Üíneutral, gaming‚Üífun, movies‚Üífun, work‚Üíneutral, studio‚Üíneutral, travel‚Üíwarm) are simplified. Consider adding follow-up questions or more nuanced mappings based on user feedback.

## High Priority: Summit-Fi Component Data Gaps

**Current Status (as of Oct 2025):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **6 high-end DACs** (>$500) - Need 15-25 more
  - Have: Chord Hugo 2, Denafrips Pontus II, Benchmark DAC3 B, RME ADI-2, Topping D90SE, Gustard X26 Pro
  - Missing: Chord DAVE/Mojo 2, Holo Audio May/Spring, Schiit Yggdrasil, Mytek Brooklyn, etc.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5 high-end amps** (>$500) - Need 15-25 more
  - Have: Benchmark HPA4, Violectric V280, Schiit Ragnarok 2, Schiit Mjolnir 3, Topping A90 Discrete
  - Missing: SPL Phonitor, Ferrum OOR, HeadAmp GS-X, Schiit Bifrost 2, etc.
- ‚ùå **1 high-end combo** (>$500) - Need 5-10 more
  - Have: RME ADI-2 Pro FS R
  - Missing: Chord Mojo 2, Qudelix 5K, FiiO Q7, iFi Micro iDSD Signature, etc.

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ ASR import script created and executed (`scripts/scrape-asr-amps.js`)
- ‚úÖ 26 ASR components imported (12 amps, 8 DACs, 6 combos) with SINAD measurements

**Next Steps:**
1. **Expand ASR data** - Add more models from ASR database (50+ measured DACs/amps)
2. **Add competitor sources** - Head-Fi buying guides, r/headphones recommendations
3. **Price research** - Current used market pricing from Audio46, Drop, r/AVexchange
4. **Expert integration** - Merge with existing Crinacle/expert rating system

**Data Gathering Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1 (Current):** Manual ASR import - COMPLETED
2. **Phase 2:** Expand to 20-30 essential models per category via additional sources
3. **Phase 3:** Semi-automated web scraping for pricing updates
4. **Phase 4:** Community API integration

**To implement:** "Expand summit-fi component coverage to 20+ per category"

## Used Listings Page Strategy

**Current State:**
- Homepage shows actual used listings count (179+ as of latest)
- Used listings integrated into recommendations page
- Scraped data from Reddit r/AVexchange, eBay, other sources

**Proposed Separate Used Listings Page (`/used-listings`):**

**Phase 1: Basic Browse & Filter**
- **URL Structure**: `/used-listings` (separate from `/used-market` redirect page)
- **Core Features**:
  - Grid/list view of all available used listings
  - Filter by: category (cans/iems/dacs/amps), price range, condition, source
  - Search by brand/model name
  - Sort by: price, date posted, condition, location

**Phase 2: Enhanced Discovery**
- **Smart Recommendations**: "Users who viewed this also looked at..."
- **Price History**: Show if item has had price drops
- **Condition Indicators**: Visual condition ratings (Mint, Excellent, Good, Fair)
- **Source Integration**: Direct links to original listings (Reddit, eBay, etc.)

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- **Saved Searches**: Alert users when matching items appear
- **Wishlist Integration**: "Items similar to your wishlist are available"
- **Negotiation Tools**: Contact sellers through platform (long-term)
- **Verified Sellers**: Reputation system for trusted sources

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Database**: Leverage existing `used_listings` table (179 records)
- **API**: `/api/used-listings` with pagination, filtering, search
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for new listings
- **Performance**: Infinite scroll, image lazy loading, search debouncing

**User Journey:**
1. **Discovery**: User visits `/used-listings` to browse available gear
2. **Filter**: Narrows down by budget, category, condition
3. **Compare**: Views multiple similar items, checks condition/price
4. **Action**: Clicks through to original listing to purchase
5. **Follow-up**: Sets up alerts for similar items in the future

**Differentiation from Recommendations:**
- **Recommendations**: "What should I buy?" (personalized, algorithm-driven)
- **Used Listings**: "What's available right now?" (inventory-driven, market-focused)

### Active Data Sources

**1. Reddit r/AVexchange (Primary)**
- ‚úÖ Production-ready scraper
- ‚úÖ OAuth authentication working
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy matching for better accuracy
- ‚úÖ Enhanced price extraction
- Configuration: Search past month, 100 results per query
- Script: `scripts/reddit-avexchange-scraper.js`
- Rate limit: 2s between requests

**2. Head-Fi Classifieds (Secondary)**
- Integration exists but needs testing
- Script: `scripts/headfi-scraper.js`

**3. Reverb (Audio Gear)**
- Integration exists but needs API key
- Script: `scripts/reverb-integration.js`

**4. eBay ‚Üí Affiliate Model Only** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **NO API scraping** (violates TOS)
- Use affiliate links instead: `src/lib/ebay-affiliate.ts`
- See `EBAY_AFFILIATE_STRATEGY.md` for details

**Running Scrapers:**
```bash
# Test Reddit scraper
node scripts/test-reddit-scraper-production.js

# Run full Reddit scrape (all components)
node scripts/reddit-avexchange-scraper.js

# Unified aggregator (all sources)
node scripts/unified-listing-aggregator.js reddit
```

## GitHub Actions Setup for Staging Automation

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**: Personal access token from Vercel dashboard
2. **VERCEL_ORG_ID**: Organization ID = `joenangles-projects`

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tokens ‚Üí Create new token
2. Copy token to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   - Name: `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - Value: [your personal access token]
3. Add org ID as GitHub secret:
   - Name: `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - Value: `joenangles-projects`

**How it works:**
- Push to staging branch ‚Üí GitHub Action triggers
- Action waits for Vercel deployment to complete
- Automatically updates staging.hifinder.app alias to point to new deployment
- Provides verification and error logging

**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/staging-alias.yml` - Main automation workflow

## Claude Code Skill Development

**User Request:** Be proactive about suggesting optimizations and advanced techniques

**Current Level:** ~3 weeks experience
- ‚úÖ Basic file operations, bash commands
- ‚úÖ Background processes, multi-tool calls
- ‚úÖ Database queries, git workflows
- üéØ **Next:** Project files, advanced patterns, automation

**Optimization Areas to Watch:**
- Suggest parallel tool usage when sequential operations are independent
- Recommend Glob over manual file searches
- Point out MultiEdit opportunities for complex refactoring
- Suggest background processes for long-running tasks
- Share advanced grep/search patterns

## Database Enhancement Procedures

**Successfully Established Patterns (Sept 2025):**

### Dual-Layer Sound Signature System
```sql
-- Basic compatibility layer (existing)
sound_signature: 'neutral' | 'warm' | 'bright' | 'fun'

-- Expert data layer (new)
crinacle_sound_signature: 'Bright neutral', 'Mild V-shape', 'Dark neutral', etc.
```

**Implementation:** Progressive enhancement in recommendations algorithm
- Basic signatures for broad matching
- Detailed signatures for nuanced scoring when available
- Null values treated as bonus-only (no penalties)

### Expert Data Integration Workflow

**1. Data Preparation:**
```bash
# CSV format with columns: Model, CrinSignature, CrinValue, CrinRank, etc.
# Supports both CSV and ODS formats via xlsx package
```

**2. Fuzzy Matching Pipeline:**
```javascript
// Key functions in scripts/merge-crinacle-cans.js
splitBrandAndModel()     // Handle multi-word brands
fuzzyMatch()             // Levenshtein similarity ‚â• 0.8
levenshteinDistance()    // String comparison
```

**3. Sound Signature Normalization:**
```javascript
// Comprehensive mapping for constraint compliance
const signatureMap = {
  'Neutral': 'neutral',
  'Bright neutral': 'bright',
  'Bass-rolled neutral': 'neutral',
  'Warm neutral': 'warm',
  'Mild V-shape': 'fun',
  'Dark neutral': 'neutral',
  // ... 20+ mappings for edge cases
};
```

**4. Batch Processing Pattern:**
```bash
# Dry run (preview changes)
node scripts/merge-crinacle-cans.js data.csv

# Execute updates
node scripts/merge-crinacle-cans.js data.csv --execute
```

### Proven Results
- **398 components enhanced** (82 headphones + 316 IEMs)
- **100% constraint compliance** (fixed all 165 signature violations)
- **Category correction** (headphones mislabeled as IEMs)
- **Recommendation quality boost** via detailed signature matching

### Reusable Components
- `scripts/merge-crinacle-cans.js` - Production fuzzy matcher
- `MULTI_WORD_BRANDS` array - Handle "Audio Technica", "Ultimate Ears", etc.
- Signature mapping dictionaries for other expert sources
- Dry-run ‚Üí execute safety pattern

### Future Applications
- ASR measurement data integration
- Head-Fi community ratings
- Other expert reviewer data (Z Reviews, DMS, etc.)
- Price/availability updates from retailers

**Key Insight:** Dual-layer approach preserves backward compatibility while enabling sophisticated matching for users who benefit from expert-level distinctions.

## Advanced Sound Signature Filtering Ideas

**Current State (Sept 2025):**
- Basic 4 categories: neutral, warm, bright, fun (559 components)
- Detailed Crinacle signatures: ~20 variations like "Bright neutral", "Mild V-shape" (398 components)
- Users currently limited to basic dropdown selection

**HMW Display More Detailed Filtering:**

### 1. Progressive Disclosure - Expandable Categories
```
‚òê Neutral (89 items) [+]
   ‚òê Bright neutral (23)
   ‚òê Warm neutral (31)
   ‚òê Bass-rolled neutral (12)
   ‚òê DF-neutral (8)
```
**Pros:** Familiar starting point, expert depth on demand, maintains hierarchy
**Cons:** Could get complex with many subcategories, requires nested UI logic

### 2. Visual Signature Map
Interactive 2D grid: X-axis (warm‚Üíbright), Y-axis (laid-back‚Üíenergetic)
- Plot signatures as clickable regions with component counts
- Hover shows signature description + sample components
**Pros:** Intuitive spatial understanding, visual relationships clear
**Cons:** Requires careful signature positioning, complex responsive design

### 3. Multi-Select with Live Preview
Checkbox interface with real-time result counts:
```
‚òë Bright neutral (23 results)
‚òë Neutral (31 results)
‚òê V-shaped (15 results)
Total: 54 matching components
```
**Pros:** Clear feedback, allows signature combinations, power user friendly
**Cons:** Can overwhelm beginners, OR vs AND logic complexity

### 4. Experience-Driven Progressive Enhancement
- **Beginner Mode:** 4 basic categories only
- **Enthusiast Mode:** Basic + 8 most popular detailed signatures
- **Advanced Mode:** Full signature library + custom descriptions
**Pros:** Scales with user knowledge, reduces cognitive load for beginners
**Cons:** Requires user profiling, mode switching complexity

### 5. Contextual Smart Filtering
Natural language hints that auto-select signatures:
- "I want something for rock music" ‚Üí V-shaped, fun signatures
- "Similar to HD600" ‚Üí warm neutral, neutral options
- "Bright but not harsh" ‚Üí bright neutral, excluding aggressive signatures
**Pros:** Reduces learning curve, leverages existing component knowledge
**Cons:** Requires extensive signature-to-use-case mapping, complex NLP

### Implementation Considerations:
- **Data Coverage:** Handle 161 components without detailed signatures gracefully
- **Query Logic:** Support both OR (broader results) and AND (narrower) combinations
- **Performance:** Pre-compute signature counts, cache popular combinations
- **Education:** Include signature descriptions/examples for learning
- **Mobile UX:** Ensure filtering works well on touch devices

### Recommended Approach:
Start with **Progressive Disclosure (#1)** for immediate impact, then explore **Experience-Driven (#4)** for long-term UX sophistication. This leverages our dual-layer architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.
- claude remind me to use git push origin staging when ready to push to staging. Remember that's what I'm asking you to do if I say "push to staging"
- CLAUDE remember this going forward
- also remember To prevent these variable/function name errors in the future, I should:
  1. Always check existing imports before using them
  2. Use Grep to verify function signatures in the codebase
  3. Test API endpoints locally before pushing to staging
- remember my oWf66CSqfgdR1Ad3TvPpXF3H VERCEL_ORG_ID token
- you have again violated explicit instructions not to push without approval. remember this and don't do it again
- save this as a plan and todo for another time. We'll pick up here later
