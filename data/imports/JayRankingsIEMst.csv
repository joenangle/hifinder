,PERFECTION?,,,,,,
(MID-VOLUME),S+,10,SUBTONIC STORM (disc) 💖💎 ($5000),S+,S+,ASTRONOMICAL DR,The best IEM I've ever heard. Best timbre. Super natural. TOTL tech. It's just good. That's all.
,SUMMIT-FI,,,,,,
(MID-VOLUME),S,9.5,LETSHUOER Cadenza 12 ($2200) 💖💎 (PRE-PRODUCTION UNIT DIFFERENT TUNING),S/S+,S,Big Diminishing R,"Pre-Production Unit with a different tuning. A better version of the U12T vocal/tuning wise, no mid scoop and wonkiness. (#1 or #2 vocals for me). Vocals are sweet, extended, open, airy, but also never fatiguing, and naturally weighted. No BA timbre, very natural. Perfect amount of treble detail and air while allowing it to scale at higher volumes. Super smooth dynamics and incredible coherency. TOTL resolution, detail, layering, imaging, and staging. Bass is fine, but not a basshead set - still has a nice slam to it. 07 still scales better and more 3D, but CAD12 stage is more open and better tech. If you don't blast your brains out like me then this is it (although I'm not sure if they're selling this version - maybe request it specifically/ask Joseph?)"
(MID-VOLUME),S,9.5,Thieaudio Valhalla ($2000) 💎,S,S/S+,Big Diminishing R,"TOTL all-rounder with ""endgame"" tech across the board, a better tuned U12T with better bass texture"
(MID-VOLUME),S,9.5,LETSHUOER Cadenza 12 2024 ($2200) 💎,S/S- ,S+,Big Diminishing R,"Very technical all-rounder, treble air is amazing, bright leaning, a little more treble detail than OG"
(MID-VOLUME),S,9.5,LETSHUOER Cadenza 12 ($2200) 💎,S/S- ,S+,Big Diminishing R,"Retail version has more treble energy and less mid-bass vs pre-production tuning. Very airy and detailed, amazing layering, and one of the most resolving TOTL IEMs along with U12T. "
(MID-VOLUME),S,9.5,FatFreq Grand Maestro ($3000) 💎,S/S- ,S,Big Diminishing R,The best basshead set. That is all. EXPENSIVE. If you just want bass HBB Punch way better value.
(MID-HIGH VOLUME),S/S- ,9,LETSHUOER MYSTIC 8 ($1000) 💖💎🌟,S/S- ,S/S- ,Worth it,"Vocal benchmark for female vocals under $2000. Clean, airy, sweet, ethereal. Better than Diva and direct upgrade to OG Oracle and OG Mangird Tea. What the Braindamage and Cantor wishes they could be. Great technical performance, and scales decently well. Recommended listening volume is mid to high volume around 75-80dbs. Not for bassy libraries like hiphop, and can be a bit energetic on kpop/jpop/rock stuff with a lot of treble. "
(MID-VOLUME),S/S- ,9,Thieaudio Monarch MK4 ($1150) 💎🌟,S/S- ,S/S- ,Worth it,"Smooth, clean, balanced, and slightly airy in the balance switch. Goes from a clean all-rounder to a warm/bassy all-rounder. Great tech. Basically a cheaper Prestige LTD with more tuning options. ""Endgame"" for most people, but the case is SHIT. "
(MID-VOLUME),S/S- ,9,Thieaudio Prestige LTD ($1299) 💎,S/S- ,S/S- ,Worth it,"Clean and natural signature with treble emphasis. LOTS of details with airy treble without going overboard (better treble extension vs MK2/MK3). Bass is not as impactful versus MK3 but has better separation. Overall a technical monster, but can be a bit dry due to less mid-bass. Vocals are further vs MK3 and MK2 (not as forward), giving it that open sense of space. MK2 still the best for vocals, but LTD is an endgame all-rounder."
(MID-VOLUME) ,S/S- ,9,Symphonium Crimson ($1500) 💎,S/S- ,S/S- ,Worth it,U-shaped/Slight V/W Shaped. Energetic treble. Great tech. Fun signature. 
(MID-VOLUME),S/S- ,9,Sony-IER Z1R ($1700) 💎,S/S- ,S/S- ,Kinda Worth it,"Best of the best in most areas, but vocals and mids can be thin due to fit issues. Insane bass texture/detail and HUGE soundstage. One of the best trebles I've heard.  "
(MID-VOLUME) ,S/S- ,9,Empire Ears Raven ($3600) 💎,S/S- ,S/S- ,Big Diminishing R,V/W Shaped. Energetic treble. Great tech. Fun bass and engaging signature. Overpriced?
(MID-VOLUME),S/S- ,9,Kinera Imperial Loki ($3100) 💎,S/S- ,S/S- ,Big Diminishing R,Super clean and clear sound. Beautiful vocals. Everyhting is extremely well balanced. No special sauce tho.
(MID-VOLUME) ,S/S- ,9,Thieaudio Prestige OG ($1299) 💎,S/S- ,S/S- ,Worth it,"Sub-bass boost + treble boost. Similar to Crimson, lots of treble energy, great tech, more aggresive LTD. "
,ENDGAME,,,,,,
(HIGH-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,LETSHUOER EJ07 ($900) 💖💎,S+,A+,Worth it (High VOL),"TOTL mids. Most 3D and holographic staging yet. Imaging, separation, layering, and staging are all S level - only thing that's holding it back is the darker treble which can lead to softer notes vs, Diva, for example.The most immersive set for rock, alternative, ballads, and classical. An 07M that scales better with better staging. Great clarity and seperation. Treble is pushed back but still clear and evident in tracks (at higher volumes). Could use more low-end (but not an issue) and sharper note transients. Takes you on a journey. Needs to be listened to at high volume for the full effect. "
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Softears RSV OG ($730) 💖💎 (unit variance),S/S+,A+,Worth it,"One of the best vocals I've heard on any IEM (especially for male artists). Mids and Treble is TOTL, smooth and well extended and has great naturalness and the perfect bite. Bass has great speed and still slams (even though it's BA? not rumbly), but stage and detail is average at it's price, but once it clicks with a track it's one of the most beautiful thing ever. Ran into distortion issues at high volume, but may be due to my source? (RSV too sensitive?) "
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Thieaudio Monarch MK2 ($999) 💖💎,S,S- ,Worth it,"Neutral tuning with one of the clearest mid-ranges. Natural and clean vocals. Great resolution, separation, and detail. Can be a little dry with its analytical presentation. Bass is well-seperated from other instruments, but nothing special especially at $1K. Would've liked more depth, and treble is also a bit unstable and dips, resulting in a lack of air/depth. Mid-bass is just enough for my library, but would've liked more for genres like hiphop and rock. Cable is heavy, and fit may be too big for many (need to shove in deep)."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Thieaudio Monarch MK3 ($999) 💎,S/S- ,S- ,Worth it,"Better low-end texture and overall more engaging than MK2, but lacks the mid-range/vocal magic, so depending on your preference either is great. Still TOTL tech like MK2. Great all-rounder."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Elysian Apostle ($1800),S/S- ,S- ,Big Diminishing R,"Clean, neutral, and clear vocals. Reminds me of a cleaner Volume S or slightly better OG Oracle, but very expensive, maybe if you can find one around $1000 since it's more of a sidegrade to RSV, Mystic 8, and Arcanis vocal wise. If you want clean vocals Monarch MK2 does the same thing but for $800 less."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Thieaudio Origin ($849) 💎,S/S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"Best bassy set under $1K. Bassy/thicker meta tuning. You can actually feel the reverb and vibration from the bone conduction drivers, great control and low-end texture. Mids and treble are also well extended with no major issues, although it can get sharp at times with the snares/electronic stuff ie, past 3:30 on Time by Hikaru Utada. "
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Dunu Glacier ($1149),S- ,S/S- ,Kinda Worth it,"Clean, balanced but engaging sound, clear vocals, great midrange and tech. Vocals can be a bit too forward/sharp. The most recent unit I got sounds different than the earlier ones which was bass-boosted diffuse field."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,UM MEST MK2 ($1500) 💎,S- ,S/S- ,Worth it (on sale),"TOTL imaging chops/layering. Tons of micro-details. Great bass texture. Wide and 3D staging. Can be aggressive, and get fatiguing when cranked up/long-listening sessions. "
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,UM MEST MK3 ($2100) 💎,S- ,S/S- ,Big Diminishing R,"A more neutral/slightly warm MEST MK2, less aggresive, easier to the ears, same technicalities. A little overpriced ngl."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,UM MEST OG (disc),S- ,S/S- ,Worth it (on sale),A MEST MK2 with slightly more uppermid/bass. More v-shaped. More AGGRESSIVE than MK2. Also gets fatiguing when cranked up/long-listening sesisons. 
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Symphonium Helios SE ($1200) 💎,S- ,S- ,Worth it,"Best Treble around it's price. Super airy but still smooth. Bass-scoop isn't as bad as I thought, but those who want mid-bass - avoid it."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Thieaudio HYPE 10 ($899) 💎,S- ,S- ,Kinda Worth it,"U-shaped, nice treble extention and dynamics, solid vocals, more low-end emphasis than MK3, dynamic and great all-rounder that doesn't specialize in anything."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,XENNS TOP PRO ($499) 🌟🌟,S- ,S- ,Good Value,"Very technical, amazing resolution and detail for the price, treble is slightly crispy and sparkly, clean but dynamic all-rounder. Mid-volume set for the most part as treble can get hot at higher volumes. Easy rec, direct upgrade from Astrals."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,NICEHCK Rockies ($499) 🌟🌟,S- ,S- ,Good Value,"Balanced, clean, airy, with a slight treble emphasis, good EST implementation, great overall package and accesories at the price. Similar to TOP PRO but with ESTs and not as vocal centric. Easy rec if you want something balanced and airy."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,AFUL Dawn-X ($1299),S- ,S- ,Kinda Worth it,"Smooth treble, natural timbre, good sub-bass focused set, but transients can be a bit soft, and vocals are pulled back lacking final extension - non-fatiguing but not very engaging and ""dynamic"". A bassier 5+2 with smoother/more natural treble. Reminds me of the Luna but less mid-bass/vocals, more sub, and a little smoother. Bassy all-rounder like MK4 bass switch but with pulled back vocals, and less versatile since no switch option. "
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,TangZu Xuan Wu Gate ($650) 🌟 ($500 on sale),S- ,S- ,Worth it,"Clean, neutral, balanced, technical, laid back, very detailed. Neutral tuning done right while being a little dynamic/engaging. Tip wise Azla spinfits for more detail, tangzu sancai regular for smoother."
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,64AUDIO U12T ($2000) 💎,A+,S/S+,Big Diminishing R,"TOTL tech. Mid-scoop can affect mids/vocal texture and placement, recessed midrange, treble is harsh at high volumes. Great bass detail, but could have more impact. "
(MID-VOLUME),S- ,8.5,Empire Ears EVO ($3000) 💎,A+,S/S- ,Big Diminishing R,"Great bass texture. BC driver actually works. Very well controlled but still impactful. Great resolution. Doesn't scale well because of spicy uppermids. Vocals often gets shouty on certain tracks, also overpriced asf imo"
,GREAT (POTENTIAL ENDGAME),,,,,,
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,8,ZIIGAAT Arcanis ($399) 💖 🌟,S,A+,Worth it (GENRE SPECIFIC),"My favourite vocals under $500 (best imo). A more refined OG Mangird Tea with better resolution and tech. Recommend listening at higher volumes on slower vocal centric tracks. Don't rec hiphop or genres that needs lots of sub-bass. Can get spicy with kpop/jpop at higher volumes/don'r rec blastin with more energetic tracks, but sounds good at mid vol. Pin point imaging and open staging, good for gaming."
(MID/HIGH-VOLUME),A+,8,Softears RSV MK2 ($699),S,A+,Worth it (on sale),"Bassy dynamic all-rounder with great low-end texture that slams hard with good note-weight/body. Slight Hype 4 upgrade. Treble is smooth, and vocals are well-tuned. Overall unboxing/accesories are great... just no ESTs at its price, I'd wait for sale."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,8,Yanyin Carmen ($849) 💖,S,A,Niche (High VOL),"An OG EJ07 that does vocal scaling. A blast your brains out kinda set. Full, powerful, extended, VERY forward vocals, might be too much for some people. Reveals every last bit of emotion from the artist's voice. Makes the song very intimate and vulnerable. VERY genre depedent, check playlist in the video description. It's basically an RSV that scales at high volume. Super immersive, great centre-imaging (or as good as it gets in an IEM), and mid-bass quality competes with the MMK3 and others. Treble is dark, not for trebleheads or people who like air. Detail takes a hit, and stage is very close, like the artist is singing right infront of you. A truly unique experience, but again, it's gonna be a hit or miss for many people depending on their library and how loud they listen - NOT a mid-lower volume set... and it comes with a $2 pouch at $850 LOL, but hey, I mean they actually get away with it because when it hits, it HITS. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,8,MiM Dark Magician OG (disc) 💖,S,A,Worth it,"Weighted and airy vocals but with expansive staging. 3D/ball imaging. Coherency and dynamics are TOTL. Clear - details are ""big""/forward, but can use better separation. Super immersive. Could use more sub-bass and resolution. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,8,Softears Twilight ($930) 💖 $700 sale,S,A,Worth it (on sale),"Slightly warm/neutral, very well balanced, good scaling, TOTL male vocals, big staging, wait for sale"
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,8,Xenns Mangird Tea OG (disc) 💖,S,A,Worth it,"Discontinued, but one of the best female vocals I've heard on any IEMs at higher volume. Top tier mids under $500. Spring Tips improves vocals and treble clarity. Great around the head imaging, but imaging is less layered than 07M. Treble can be dark at lower/mid volumes, but shines when cranked up. Super immersive. High volume listening recommened. "
HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,ZIIGAAT Luna ($379) 💖 🌟,S/S- ,A+,Worth it,"Airy, smooth, warm, laid-back, balanced, lush and dreamy vibes. Great for rock/metal, scales decently high. Mid-bass over sub. Not as vocal forward as Arcanis and other vocal sets. My Luna graphs very different than HBB's - wait for more reviews."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Thieaudio Oracle OG ($539) ,S/S- ,A+,Worth it,"Amazing airy and relaxing vocals. Sweet and gentle presentation. Clean, clear vocals - could be too balanced tho. Great separation, but stage size could be better. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,ZIIGAAT Odyssey ($229) 💖 🌟🌟,S/S- ,A,Good Value,"A warm/mini Subtonic Storm that scales better and fuller with less tech. A musical odyssey. High volume set, great scaling, a cleaner/midrange focused Explorer with better layering and detail. Takes you on a journey like the OG EJ07. Bass is thumpy and rumbly at higher volumes, vocals are clean and balanced with slight treble emphasis, and very immserive. Highly recommended for slow-rock, indie/alternative, ballads, fits my preference to a T."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Softears Volume S $319 💖 (stock switch/high vol) ,S/S- ,A,Worth it,"Amazing vocals under $500 with the stock switch/clear tips or tangzu sancai regular (no impedance boost) with amazing vocal scaling. Recommended for higher volume listening like ballads, slower indie/bands. Better than Studio 4 vocal wise, but Studio 4 is the better all-rounder. Volume S is more mid/vocal centric than Studio 4, and more immersive and ""musical"". Other switch configuration offers more clarity and detail at the cost of scaling with uppermids/treble boost (cleaner harman 2019/better at mid-volume). Stock switch tuning can also be neutral and relaxing if you don't crank it up, and overall Volume S has good variety and differentiates itself with the different tunings. Also, well implemented BAs. Passive Radiator effect is questionable. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,IO Volare ($599) ($500 on sale),S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"Best Harman IEM under $600 (my unit is less harman), smooth and natural, great layering and tech, bass texture could be better/not as good as Oracle MK3, but overall very balanced and great all-rounder, also, amazing unboxing and accessories "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,HiSenior MEGA5EST 7th ($549) NEW unit,S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"New unit is better tuned/balanced, smooth, good all-rounder, and sounds like adjusted diffusefield. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,7th Acoustic Supernova ($750),S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"Super smoooth. TOTL dynamics and treble air - dunno how they managed this airy and smooth with only BAs. Very clean, no sharpness, or sudden peaks, endgame separation and detail. Only drawback is that the sub-bass is a bit meh, and that the sound isn't that ""unique"". Very safe all-rounder, and one of the best under $1000. Endgame set. Aside from the bass, everything else is better than Monarch MK3, MK2 still has better vocals, but the Supernova beats them when it comes to treble extention and smootheness - too bad it's impossible to get one lol."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Thieaudio Oracle MK3 ($589),S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"Great bass texture, much better than predecessors, smooth and slightly airy giving it a sizzly timbre, great layering/separation, vocals are slightly laid back but not gone, very balanced across frequencies, monitor like, great all-rounder, and pretty safe - although not very dynamic and ""fun"". Azla clear tips gives a detail boost."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,XENNS UP ($699) with AZLA tips,S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"Fast and clean bass but still rumbly and punchy. Beryllium DD baby. Well-seperated mids, and vocals still pop and aren't buried like other bass sets. Can use more treble extension (fixed with AZLA sedna tips). "
NEW (MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Ziigaat Horizon ($329) 🌟,S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"""Meta"" inspired tuning, basically a slightly more detailed Astral with smoother treble and less sub-bass. Less aggressive/in your face vs Astrals. Great details and tech for the price, bright-leaning."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,LETSHUOER EJ07M ($600)  (discontinued) ,S- ,A+,Worth it,Holographic staging with an amazing midrange. Great bass texture and impact. Incredibly immersive and endgame for most. Has more sub-bass and treble air than OG doesn't scale as well.
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Thieaudio HYPE 4 ($399) ,S- ,A+,Worth it,"One of the best all-rounders under $600 (v-shaped harman). Treble quality is smooth and well extended. Great low-end texture with lots of impact. Good vocals. Solid tech, and just solid in general."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,XENNS Tea Pro ($359) ,S- ,A+,Worth it,"A more resolving Davinci, literally. The Tea magic is gone :( but it's now the most refined and well-balanced. It's the most bassy one with better low-end texture, heavier notes, more details, better resolution, and the better all-rounder pick. Also bassy balanced like the Hype 4, both are just as good to me, and comes down to what I'm feeling that day"
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Softears RSV MK1 no-unit variance ($729),S- ,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Clean, balanced, full, natural, uppermids/vocal emphasis. Still a mid-range set, but vocals don't pop as much as the RSV I originally got, aka not as saucy. Recent unit is still a good balanced vocal set for male vocals, but not as special and very pricey, maybe on sale. This is the RSV MK1 tuning most people will get... guess I got a rare 1 of 1 lol."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Elysian Pilgrim Noir ($799),S- ,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Good but expensive. Recommended if you can find it for around $500. Direct upgrade to the AFUL Explorer. Scales great. Reminds me of the EJ07M but a bit smoother and less dynamic. Prefer it more than the OG pilgrim, but definitely not worth $400 more lol."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Symphonium Titan ($999),S- ,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Most balanced bass set I've heard so far without sacrificing the fun/texture/impact in the low-end. Open staging, full sounding, deep sub-bass, vocals aren't buried either. No big peaky treble, good extension. No real issues aside from the price maybe. A very unique bass experience since usually the low-end overtakes the other fr, but with the Titan you can hear everything while having that impactful/authoritative bass."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Kiwi Ears Astral ($299) 🌟,S- ,A+,Worth it,"Great all-rounder. Slighty airy with good sub-bass extenion. Balanced but still fun. A cleaner, airier, and less sharp/sparkly version of the Meta/Crescent - vocals pop out more. Tip rec Sancai regular or Softears Ultra clears."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Softears Studio 4 ($449) ($350 on sale),S- ,A+,Worth it (on sale),"""Correct"" and neutral tuning. Natural vocals, not as forward like RSV but zero faults. Slight Improvement over RSV in-terms of seapration and stage size/treble is same/not as warm."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,ORIVETI OH700VB ($799),S- ,A+,Big Diminishing R,"Replaced by Astral. A more engaging Supernova, cleaner, with better sub-bass, and vocals. Very big stage and fantastic separation and layering. Vocals are airy without being too sharp. Lots of air/reminds me of the LTD. Mid-bass scoop can affect some libraries like HIPHOP and EDM, but perfect for indie/ballads/acoustics/intrumentals and slower songs."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,ZIIGAAT Crescent ($279),S- ,A/A+,Worth it,"Slightly warm, full, and sparkly/crispy treble. A warmer TOP PRO with a step down in technical performance. Treble can get much on kpop/jpop/energetic tracks. Mid-volume set, doesn't scale as well as Odyssey but has better tech."
(MID/HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,YU9 Que ($399),S- ,A/A+,Kinda Worth it,"Smooth listen, non-fatiguing, balanced and leans towards neutral, scales good, full, natural, but lacks dynamics/transients and vocal extension. Reminds me of the OG SA6 with a little more treble and low-end, but less mids, and even more pulled back vocals... Similar to the Meta tunings, reminds me of a more neutral Astral/Crescent/Horizon - Good, but a bit overhyped and priced a bit high for a 1DD+3BA, tech is slightly behind the Astrals and should be under $300 imo. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Kiwi Ears x HBB PUNCH ($449) 💖,S- ,A,Worth it,"Endgame ""balanced-basshead"" set. Amazing low-end texutre, rumble, reverb, slam, and more bass than Origin and Titan - goes harder than those. Vocals and treble also still well extended, not congested, or cramped staging. Good balance while giving amazing fun bass. Recommend Azla Sedna light blue tips for more air, or Divinus Velvets. EQ down -3dbs at 250hz, low-shelf, 0.5 Q, and you'll get the Endgame IE target (my all-rounder target). "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Punch Audio Martilo ($329) 🌟,S- ,A,Worth it,"Cheaper, and slightly more energetic HBB Punch with slightly less mid-bass and slam. Endgame ""balanced"" basshead. Imaging feels sharper than Punch, but treble is not as smooth, aside from that very similar tech and low-end."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,EPZ K9 ($300) ,A+/S-,A+,Worth it,"All-rounder with slight v-shape tonality. EW300 upgrade. Natural and sweet vocals, nice mid-bass slam, treble is nicely extended, well-balanced with a mix of smoothness and contrast, and great packaging and design. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,DUNU x Precogvision Mirai ($1100) ,A+,S- ,Kinda Worth it,"Bright leaning set with great tech. Clean mid-range, sharp imaging, sparkly female vocals with decent amount of air. Does get fatiguing and sharp on more energetic tracks and genres like EDM/POP/KPOP/JPOP, aka lower to mid volume set. Sounds very good on slower genres like indie, acoustics, ballads - adds more energy and liveliness to the slower nature of those genres. Mid-bass is lacking and would not recommend for rock or hiphop."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Thieaudio Monarch OG (disc) ,A+,S- ,Disc,"Endgame clarity and layering. Clean, clear, and balanced all-rounder sound. Great resolution, and open staging. Rumbly sub-bass but mid-bass tuck can kill some libraries and affect vocal thinness. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Yanyin Moonlight ($649),A+,A+/S-,Kinda Worth it,"Balanced, smooth, and clean presentation that scales beautifully with slightly forward/powerful vocals."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,SIMGOT EM10 ($439) ($350-400 on sale),A+,A+/S-,Worth it,A more immersive version of the Pilgrim with better mid-bass kick. More airy and slightly more detailed in the treble. Harman vocal gain might be too much for some. Bass might be boomy depending on the tips. Use Tangzu Sancai tips (regular)
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,XENNS TOP ($530) ($400 on sale),A+,A+/S-,Worth it on sale,"What the Variations should've been. Fantastic tehcnincalities. Neutral-bright leaning. Nothing wrong with it at mid-volume, but I can see treble can be too much at highet volumes. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,TangZu Bajie ($599),A+,A+/S-,Kinda Worth it,"Clean/balanced meta tuning with sharp imaging and transients - an edgier take on the meta tuning, more dynamic. Has great potential for EQ due to its bigger 14.2MM bass. Low-end is more prominent than the graph suggest, great bass texture and impact, although the bone conduction driver is more subtle vs the Origin. Clear sound with great separation, can run into some peaks around 5K, and tonality has more bite vs smooth but not overly sharp or jarring."
(Deep-fit),A+,7.5,Dunu SA6 ULTRA (disc),A+,A+/S-,Worth it,"An SA6 with improvement in treble extension, and stage air; better tuned Oracle2 with wider stage. Relaxing tonality but also very resolving. Airy stage with great depth and height. Smooth dynamics and great coherency. Realistic timbre. Great detail and clarity. Mids and vocals may not be forward enough for some genres. Low-end is quick and has great separation form mids but lacks rumble and slam. Tuning A+ to S- depending on your library. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Yanyin Canon Pro ($399),A+,A+,Worth it,"Clean, neutral, balanced. Airy treble but smooth, great tech. Recommend UP UP switch with bass boost. A smoother pilgrim basically. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,CrinEar Meta ($249)  (sold out),A+,A+,Worth it,"Bright-leaning all-rounder with sparkly treble sauce. Great tech for price and great accessories. Good coloration that's not vanilla and safe as other crin collabs. Can be fatiguing at higher volumes, tip dependent, rec sancai wide/regular or Softear Ultra Clear/EPZ clear tips. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,EPZ 530 ($430) ,A+,A+,Kinda Worth it,Great set for jazz/blues/soul/acoustic. Thick and lush. Warm but with nice treble extension. Solid tech. Vocals can be overly husky and buried in busier songs. 
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Elysian Pilgrim ($399),A+,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Clean, clear, all-rounder, similar tuning as the Dusk but with better vocals, bass quality is great as well, aethestically pleasing too. If you want a clean all-rounder, or sensitive in the 3-8K, these are great."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Dunu SA6 ($550) ,A+,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Gorgeous mid range and great dynamics. Good timbre makes me forget it's a full BA set. Good bass texture, but wish it had more rumble. Wish stage and imaging was more 3D. Could use more treble air and staging. Relaxed listening vs 07M's immersion. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Moondrop Illustrious ($1000),A+,A+,Big Diminishing R,"Basically the Softears Twilight with less sub-bass extension, alot more neutral and monitor like, and very pricy since Twilight goes on sale for $700 with a more musical playback. This is just neutral. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,TangZu Tian Peng  ($629),A/A+,S- ,Kinda Worth it,"A cleaner more neutral Bajie with less bass and more treble energy. Clean, slightly vocal forward with some bite. Azla tips for more bass and treble energy/bite but can get shouty - Sancai Nobles for a smoother/neutral/montior like sound. Great tech, but wish it had ESTs like its competition."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Effect GAEA ($1299) ,A,S/S- ,Kinda Worth it,"Super aggresive, exciting, v-shape, treblehead. Low-end is also very punchy and rumbly. TOTL technical performance with tons of details and OCD, but gets fatiguing. Shouty."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Aur Neon Pro ($720),A,A+/S-,Kinda Worth it,"Slightly edgier Supernova with punchier low-end. Not as smooth and refined, but more engaging."
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Moondrop Variations ($520) ,A,A+/S-,Kinda Worth it,"Very clear with lots of detail. Sub-bass has a nice rumble and texture. Amazing treble extension and stage air. Female vocals are vibrant and shines. Mid-bass cut is real, affecting some genres and male vocals. Note-weight can be light. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Sennheiser IE600 ($700),A,A+/S-,Kinda Worth it,"Tons of detail and amazing clarity. Stage is smaller than most IEMs at/below its price tag but very well defined details and imaging within that space. Bass is detailed, but amount is not as much as graph would suggest. Treble gets sharp and fatiguing at longer-listening/higher volumes. Stage can feel cramped. "
(MID-VOLUME),A+,7.5,Dunu SA6 MK2 ($580) ,A,A+/S-,Kinda Worth it,V-shaped SA6 Ultra with more recessed mids and vocals. Sharper and more bass than SA6U but mids are buried in busier tracks.

Insane scaling, better than DX1 scaling wise, amazing musicality, non-fatiguing, warm, but also has powerful/extended vocals. Great for male vocals, husky, but not congested or nasally. Super immersive, intimate but big sounding without feeling congested. Tip rec: TRI Clarions. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,LETSHUOER DX1 ($159) 💖,S- ,A-/A,Worth it (Vocals),"Dynamic, vibrant, and contrasty vocals with good balance and scaling. Natural, full, and immersive with scaling and not peaky. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Xenns Mangird Tea 2 ($350) 💖,A+/S-,A/A+,Worth it,"Slightly more technical version of the OG TEAs. Thumpier low end, and treble is more extended. Less forward presentation. Stage has more depth. Can't scale as well as OG. Vocals are not as ""magical"" as OG. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,ZIIGAAT ODYSSEY 2 ($249) ,A+/S-,A/A+,Worth it,"Balanced all-rounder with a slight vocal/mid-centric presentation. Vocal scaler. Snappy/punchy/tight bass. A cleaner, smoother, and more mid-centric Odyssey aka no more bass sauce and bite. Rec with higher volume for full potential."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Symphonium Meteor ($500)  💖,A+/S-,A-/A,Worth it,"Meaty textured mid-bass, but can be a bit much. VVery warm sound. Library dependent. Airy treble, but vocals are a bit pushed back and buried."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,ZIIGAAT LUSH ($179),A+/S-,A-/A,Worth it,"A cleaner more technical AFUL Explorer with a more open sense of space and airier treble. High volume set. Very smooth and balanced at higher scaling - has a ""Lush"" and full sound. Mid-volume sounds kinda anemic and too inoffensive, wouldn't rec at lower volumes unless you're using as background music while working, but very immersive with scaling like the Odyssey, but less v and more chill."
(MID/HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,ZIIGAAT DOSCINCO ($269) ,A+/S-,A-/A,Worth it,"Benchmark bass set before the UP. Low-end is impactful, rumbly, heavy, and slams hard with reverb detail. Ideal for hiphop/rap/r&b/rock. Separation & resolution not the best around its price, but enough for what it's going for."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,ZIIGAAT x HBB Arcadia ($200) ,A+/S-,A-,Worth it,"Niche/high volume set. Great scaling, warm, bassy, thick, comforting listen. A mini MEGA5EST Bass. Initmate and immersive experience. Not the most technical for the price, and vocals can be a bit too husky."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Simgot EA1000 ($220) non-bright unit,A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Bright-leaning with the best bass texture at its price point, and one of the best under $500. Incredible resolution and clarity with stunning female vocals. Timbre is as natural as you can get given its price. There is some masking in the vocals just like most IEMs with a 1.5-2K peak, and treble does get too energetic with certain genres like KPOP/EDM. However, mesh filters+gold nozzle fixes this for the most part."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Yanyin HBB Mahina ($649),A+,A/A+,Kinda Worth it,Warm and intimate signature. Vocals are very forward but lacks treble air. Needs scaling.
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Thieaudio Hype 2 ($299) ,A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Mini-Monarch MK3 with less bass and details. 80% there. Harmanish tuning, and best all-rounder before Studio 4. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,ZIIGAAT CINCOTRES ($269),A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Great bass texture, vocals, treble, solid all-rounder. Similar to Variations but with a smaller/delayed scoop, more mid-bass, but not as much treble/air. A fun bassy sound but still well-balanced. Correct polarity. "

(MID-VOLUME),A,7,7Hz Timeless 2 ($229),A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Good all-rounder set with solid tech. Good variety with the nozzles that actually changes the sound. Treble is smoother than other planars, and not much ""planar timbre"". "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Letshuoer Cadenza 4 ($250) ,A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Slightly bright, clean sound, very airy, sweet vocals. Great separation and resolution. Reminds me of the OG Orcales. Follows Harman 2019 but with more air. Needs more low-end, not an all-rounder. Not rec for hiphop, kpop, rock. Very good for indie, ballads, classical and acoustics. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,MYER CKLVX D62 ($245)  Sancai Wides,A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Very good all-rounder set with great dynamics on top. Stage is wide with great technical performance. Vocals pop out just enough, bass is tactile with good slam, overall a solid set if you want a more engaging set that does everything very well. Only downside is that it can be a bit sharp with stock tips - highly recommend TangZu Sancai Wide tips, helps smoothens out and open the sound - mandatory for max potential "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,MYER SL224 ($300),A+,A/A+,Kinda Worth it,"Same tuning as the EPZ P50 but fancier with a little more sub-bass, and slightly more detailed in the treble but barely noticeable. This is ""technically"" better, but P50 would be the better value since you can get it for around $160 on sale."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,EPZ P50 ($200) 🌟 $160 on sale,A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Clean balanced tuning done right. A better tuned MEGA5EST & MOONDROP Meteor with fuller low-end, and more treble extension, same tech, but more dynamic - also half the price. A Mega5EST with better vocals and dynamics but less smooth and airy. Low-end will be weak to some people and on certain tracks. Not the most unique sound since it's clean/neutral/balanced."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,CrinEar DayBreak ($169) 🌟,A+,A/A+,Worth it,"Here we go again. Very similar tuning as P50 and SL224. Less vocal centric vs P50s, but more bassy and all-rounded. Slightly slightly less technical than SL224."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,FlipEars LEGION ($849),A+,A,Kinda Worth it,"Fun and bassy, v-shape, great low-end slam and texture, full, rumbly, solid tech imaging, and cool faceplate... but price is a bit high."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Kiwi Ears Orchestra Lite ($250) old unit,A+,A-/A,Kinda Worth it,"Great vocals. Clean and neutral signature. A bit vanilla and ""boring"" but scales great with volume. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Hisenior MEGA5 EST BASS ($600),A+,A-/A,Eh,"The Mega5est 7th but with more sub-bass. That's it. Does sound better now, more ""musical"" and less vanilla and boring. A good comforting and smooth listen that scales well. Bass texture isn't as good as Tea Pro, Hype 4, Estrella tho. Similar to 61T, a bit smooth in the bass, but a better version of it in the timbre and vocals/treble. ESTs are not obvious but more subtle while being well-balanced in the mids and treble. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Seeaudio Yume OG ($169),A+,A-/A,Worth it,"Vocal benchmark along with EPZ P50 until Volume S, OG Oracles and RSV for most - natural and open vocals. Midranged focus, can use better bass texture and treble extension."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Dunu x Gizaudio Davinci ($299),A+,A-/A,Kinda Worth it,"Warm leaning with thick, thumpy mid-bass that hits pretty deep and hard. Decent vocal and treble extension, although female vocals are warmer and huskier. Good for hiphop, rap, r&b, but low-end isn't fast enough for busier genres like rock for example. Bass texture and resolution is slightly soft and not very separated, hits really hard, but sometimes bass notes feels like they've mushed together into one note. Hype 4 is straight up a better version of the Davinci when it comes to low-end texture and separation, as well as overall resolution and vocal playback; and if you're ok with EQing the Hype 2's low-end those are better as well because they use the same isobaric design as the 4s (Low-shelf, 100hz, +2-3db, Q 0.5)"
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Kiwi Ears KE4 ($200) ,A+,A-,Worth it,"Just get Odyssey it's better. Warm/bassy with solid vocal and treble extension (not buried) that scales really well with good treble air to not sound too intimate. Has a fuller noteweight with one of the best low-ends under $200. Recommended to be listened at higher volumes. A mid-volume version of the Explorer, bassier, and more open."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Moondrop x Crinacle DUSK 2nd Unit ($359),A/A+,A+,Worth it,"Fills in the uppermids, better extension, less 8-10K peak, less channel imbalance, and just a better tuning overall versus the first unit - that's chifi qc baby!!"
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,KiwiEars Septet ($269) (sancai tips),A/A+,A+,Worth it,"Bright-leaning with slight warmness - has an unique sparkly/lush, airy, and spacious sound. Great tech for the price, treble is not overly harsh or peaky (at mid volume), pretty smooth with the extra mid-bass balancing out the treble boost. Vocals are pushed back/not fully extended and not as prominent. Mid-volume set, doesn't scale well. Gets spicy with energetic genres past mid-volume. Great for instrumentals, acoustics, indie, classical, etc. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,SIMGOT SUPERMIX4 ($150) 🌟🌟,A/A+,A+,GREAT VALUE,"Endgame Harman, one of the smoothest IEMs I've heard with Tangzu Sancai tips (regular). Some units might be hotter in the treble/pzt timbre"
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Moondrop Meteor ($499),A/A+,A+,Eh,"Neutral, clean and clear vocals, vocals pop out, good tech. Next to no planar timbre - one of the least planar like planars. Treble isn't sizzly and bright, but vocals can get shouty on energetic tracks, and doesn't scale very well. Bass is not that impactful and textured, can be a bit too pushed back in the mix. A bit too vanila like the Mega5EST, but just with more vocal emphasis now and less smooth in the treble. NO ESTS for whatever reasons, makes it less airy and smooth compared to sets with ESTs. Both Volare and Variations would still be better, and EPZ P50 is just a better tuned and cheaper version of the Meteor."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Hisenior MEGA5EST 7th ($549) old unit,A/A+,A+,Eh,"Neutral, clean, well-balanced, monitor like, great tech, but boring. Just get the TOP PRO, Oracle MK3 or Volare, or Xuan Wu Gate."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Kiwi Ears Quintet ($220) ,A/A+,A+,Worth it,"Great tech and treble detail. Amazing performance to price value, but metallic timbre and peak can be an issue. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Simgot ET142 New Nozzles ($220) ,A/A+,A+,Worth it,"Lots of variety with nozzles.Tames down 2K, keeps treble extension, basically a Timeless 2 with better fit and more detail with blue nozzle."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,Dunu Vulkan 2 ($360) Maybe at $200-250,A/A+,A/A+,Genre Specific ,"Neutral/vocal centric set with very little sub-bass. A very ""unique"" tuning for a neutral sound. Very genre dependent. Clean and clear vocals with a slight bite. Lower-mids are just enough to bring enough note-weight and body. Not recommended for anything that needs sub-bass like hiphop, rap, EDM, and some POP songs. Recommend listening volume past 70dbs with indie, ballads, acoustics, slow rock. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Kiwiears Aether ($169) 🌟,A/A+,A,Good Value,"Clean, balanced, with slight air boost in the treble. Bass sounds like a DD with great texture. Cheaper better tuned P5+2. Not as smooth as Timeless 2 with more dynamic contrast with a slight sizzle from the treble boost. Good value for a planar."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Truthear NOVA (FOAM TIPS) ($150) 🌟🌟,A/A+,A,GOOD Value ,"NEED FOAM TIPS makes the treble smooth and clear. Very clean harman sound with smooth but well extended treble/one of the best treble under $200, no roll-off. The pinnacle of trying not to offend anyone, but light bass/low-end; another harman."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Binary Dynaquattro ($260),A/A+,A,Worth it,"Natural vocals, good treble extension, bass is tight and more resolving vs 61t and Davinci. Overall very well balanced and clean. There are some small peaks at 8-10k and 15-20K which can be an issue on some songs, and there is masking around 4-8k region, but overall, solid all-rounder."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,MYER CK2V $190,A,A+,Worth it,"A better tuned version of the Braindance for 2x less. Fuller, less sizzle and artifical, better timbre, vocals are clearer. Still have slight planar sizzle but in a balanced way. Good pick if you want something neutral/bright."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,7,SIVGA Nightingale ($279),A,A+,GENRE SPECIFIC,"LESS-TREBLE UNIT. VERY GENRE SPECIFIC. Listen at HIGH VOLUME with slower tracks (slow rock, ballads, indie, jazz, blues, acoustics, instrumentals etc). TOTL stage (airy+reverb), layering, treble detail, but vocals and sub-bass are rolled-off/pushed back, losing details there otherwise would be at least be S- for tech. Treble can also be too energetic depending on the unit (a lot of them graph with lots of treble - mine doesn't sound that boosted), so in-general NOT RECOMMENDED for libraries with a lot of sub-bass (rolled-off) or energy (too sharp if you get a boosted unit). That aside, gives me OG EJ07 vibes immersion wise. Hard to recommend because unit variations. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Moondrop X Crinacle DUSK ($359) ,A,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Inoffensive safe tuning, less fatiguing uppermids good for jpop/kpop. Vocals lack the last bit of extension, detail, and power. DSP APP is a shit show. Heavy competition from Nova, Cincotres, Hype 4. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,AFUL Performer 8 ($370) ,A,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Good neutral set. Airy and open staging but with forward vocals although lacking in extension. Great layering and details but not 3D and more flat. Vocals could also be more open, and feels ""stuck""."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,JUZEAR 81T $250,A,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Clean balanced sound with good punch low-end, but... Harman 2019, just get Supermix 4 or Nova."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,HiSenior Cano Cristales ($399),A,A+,Eh,"Exciting v-shape, graphs and sounds like a more aggressive/sharper Estrella that's less smooth/refined and more peaky. Uppermids can get shouty and fatiguing. Needs some sonions to smooth things out. Maybe at $250-300 with Sancai tips. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Moondrop Blessing 3 ($320) ,A,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Bright-neutral. Slight resolution bump over the B2 Dusk, but at the cost of weak bass and sharp 6K."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Night Oblivion Butastur ($600),A,A+,Eh,"Overpriced as hell - I don't get the hype. Vocals are way too shouty with masking. Treble peaks around 10K with a dip in the air afterwards. Low-end is ""good"", but nothing amazing for the price. Detail retrieval and separation is competitive, but that's pretty much it. If you want a clean sound there are ALOT of other options for better like even the Blessing 3."
(LOW-VOLUME),A,7,FATFREQ x EA QUANTUM ($759),A-,S/S- ,Volume Specific,"Bright and full sound, very detailed, sparkly, airy, tons of treble extenstion... but it gets fatiguing with the stock filters. Blue filter has the best balance but still doesn't scale too well. 300 mesh filter goes hard tho - check modded ranking at bottom. "
(LOW-VOLUME),A,7,AFUL Cantor ($799),A-,S/S- ,Volume Specific,"LOW VOLUME SET. Clean, airy, and highly resolving at its price with endgame separation and detail. Low-end is quick, but lacks impact and a bit of texture. Notes are on the lighter side, not very full, male vocals are a little thin and recessed. Not very dynamic but clean and balanced, but can be borderline clinical. NOT RECOMMENDED past 60dbs or so, gets too shrill and fatiguing in the treble with a slight metallic timbre in the treble depending on the song. Doesn't scale very well and not that immersive, but overall very technical IEM, probably the best tech wise under $1000."
(LOW-VOLUME),A,7,Dunu DK3001 Braindamage $499,A-,S- ,Volume Specific,"Technical, but thin, and bright tilt with LOTS of planar sizzle and timbre. Needs more low-end (small scoop), noteweight is very light, not peaky, but just artificial. Needs 10hm adapter to be balanced. Not a high volume set."
(MID-VOLUME),A,7,Thieaudio Oracle MK2 ($589) ,A-,S- ,Kinda Worth it,"CLEAR with LOTS of detail. Nice sub-bass rumble with no mid-bass bleed. Treble is super extended as well as high-mids. Female vocals sound lively and sings, but can be too much at high volume and overly thin. Great imaging and separation. Artificially boosted treble, too sharp. "

(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Simgot EM6L Phoenix ($109) 🌟 Unit Variance,A/A+,A,Good Value ,"Great resolution and tech, one of the smoothest iems, but uppermids will get hot on energetic tracks at higher volumes. Slightly warm but also lively. Recent units are brighter than first batch."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Simgot EA500LM ($89) 🌟🌟,A/A+,A,GOOD VALUE,"Very resolving for its price, great value. A warmer EA1000 with a slight decrease in separation and resolution, but warmer with more bass (same bass quality). Not as sparkly and resolving as the EA1000s, treble is a little sharp/not as refined, but a better all-rounder. Has unit variance, lots of brighter units."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,CCA HYDRO ($129) 🌟,A/A+,A,Worth it,"The best KZ so far, tuning swithces allow lots of options. Good tech, all-rounder sound with bass boost, but, KZ."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Hidizs MP145 OG ($159) 🌟,A/A+,A,Good Value ,A less sharp and sizzly HeyDay. All-rounder sound with good tech. Tamer Harman/df. Solid all-rounder. 
NEW (MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,7Hz Crinacle Divine ($150),A/A+,A,Worth it,"Clean, balanced, slightly dynamic, but smooth enough. Slightly lively-neutral tuning that's good for vocal/ballads. Could use more low-end and may be a bit lean for certain libraries, but overall good tech and layering. "
NEW (MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,LETSHUOER S12 Ultra ($169),A/A+,A-/A,Worth it,"Smoothest S12 so far with fun sub-bass and good transients/dynamics. Slight v-shape, similar to the Defiant but a little more bassy. 1.5K vocal peak can be an issue on songs with no bass to cover it, but overall fine on most songs. Not as technical as OG S12/Pro, and not as good value vs cheaper planars, but trade of is Ultra is more refined, natural, and musical - I think the slight hit is worth it for a more enjoyable sound."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,SIMGOT EG280 ($80) 🌟,A/A+,A-/A,Worth it,"All-rounder with pinpoint imaging and slight uppermids/vocal emphasis. Basically a more technical EW300 with better vocal clarity and extension. Solid for gaming like EM6L, and would be my pick since it's more natural/less bright vs EM6L."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Kiwiears Airoso ($129) 🌟,A/A+,A-/A,Worth it,A sightly more airy/detailed EW300 with better timbre. Warm leaning all rounder with good dynamic contrast.

(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Tanchjim Origin ($260),A/A+,A-/A,Just Buy FISSION,"Just buy Fission. A cleaner/less warm LM, smoother EA1000 (fermats a little more resolving), very balanced, clean, and neutral sound. Very tough competition."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Kefine Quatio ($129) 🌟,A/A+,A-/A,Worth it,"A bassy all-rounder, and cleaner Doscinco for $100 less. Very versatile with the different nozzles - goes from bassy to clean all-rounder. Solid packaging and accesories. Competitive tech, but not as value like Supermix4/EM6L/EA500LM."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,6.5,KiwiEars ETUDE ($119),A/A+,A-/A,Worth it,"Reverby, bouncy, and extended decay in the sub-bass. Unique bass play back and adds more texture to the low-end. Although reverb can bleed into the vocals - maybe the drivers work too well lol. A bassier 5+2 with better texutre and scaling. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,6.5,MYER AUDIO CKLVX ($150) ,A/A+,A-/A,Good Value ,Just get Odyssey it's better. Identical tuning as PULA PA02 but cheaper and with a nicer faceplate. 
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,6.5,PULA PA02 ($190) ,A/A+,A-/A,Worth it,"Just get Odyssey it's better. Dreamy/airy treble presentation with genres like indie, slow-rock, ballads, singer-songwriter. Immersive/forward vocals that scales nicely. Bass is ok, a little boomy. 10K can be jarring with energetic genres like kpop/jpop/edm."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Softears Volume S $319 (stock switch/mid vol),A/A+,A-/A,Kinda Worth it,"Relaxed, slightly warm-neutral tuning, a bit boring, full, could use more treble/air. Not as good as high volume (recommended listening vol). "
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,LETSHUOER S15 ($329) ,A,A,Kinda Worth it,"Neutral and laid back tuning. Great layering and separation and resolution. Great treble extension and air without being too sharp and light like other planar iems. Bass is also not light and floaty, and doesn't feel like planar bass - not slamming, but tight and well-textured. Vocals are laid back, but not too pushed back although it's not the most extended and powerful, but works very-well as a neutral set. Nice and open staging, and is the direct upgrade to the Hexa and Sonus. Very good safe all-rounder."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,AFUL PERFORMER 5+2 ($240),A,A,Kinda Worth it,"Clean, balanced, neutral sound with good layering and tech. Relaxing vocals, but lacks power and last bit of vocal extension. Bass has good controll, but lacks impact. Has sizzly planar timbre in the treble. Safe but forgettable."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,TinHifi P1 MAX 2 ($139) 🌟,A,A,Good Value ,"Solid all-rounder for those who like a less bright Nova in the uppermids. Good for jpop/kpop. Timbre is good and not too ""planar"", bass texture/impact could be better."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Moondrop Blessing 2 Dusk ($320) ,A,A,Eh,"Great resolution and separation. Vocals can sound recessed/thin, and is sibilant at higher volumes. Uneven and grainy treble. Clinical, thin, and not as musical as others sets. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,MYER SLA3 ($100) ,A,A,Worth it,"Dynamic all-rounder, slightly energetic with great contrast in the uppermids and bass. Solid tech, and sound is different enough from other $100 sets. Good sidegrade to safer picks like SM4, NOVA, EM6L. Uppermids can be peaky on certain songs, and not as smooth as nova/em6l/sm4, but more engaging with better dynamic contrast. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,MYER SLIIVO SL41 ($185) ,A,A,Kinda Worth it,"Solid all-rounder for those who like a slightly warm-neutral sound, Nova better all-rounder tho"

(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,IO Sogno ($399),A,A,Big Diminishing R,"Literally Harman 2019. Inoffensive and good all-rounder. A little sharp in the timbre vs Volare (I'd just save up for the Volare if you want Harman), more low-end than Volare, better bass and timbre than Supermix4 but not as good in value."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,TinHifi T7 ($200),A,A,Kinda Worth it,Harman 2019
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Moondrop Harmon ($350),A,A,NAH,"Clean Harman 2019 sound. Clear and balanced, but can still be shouty in the vocals. New Crossover and 3DD talk is marketing jargon not that much difference vs other DDs. You can just buy Nova or SUPERMIX4 if you want Harman for more than half the price. Or DynnaQuattro and Chopin is better as well. Sounds ""decent"" but just overpriced. Also looks like a knockoff cybertruck from temu. Avoid unless you can find it for around $150 or less. "
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Tang Zu x HBB HeyDay ($200) ,A,A,Kinda Worth it,Clean and neutral with treble emphasis. Great technical performance. Airy and lively treble. Bass could use more impact and weight. Vocals are on the lighter side of things.

(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,LETSHUOER EJ07 ($900)  (MID-VOLUME),A,A,Eh,"Treble is dark and a bit hard to hear at lower volumes. Needs to be cranked up to hear the details. Imaging, spearation, and staging is top tier, if it weren't for the lower sharpness/not as sparkly, 07 at higher volumes would be an S for tech."
(MID-VOLUME),A,6.5,Softears Volume S $319 (switch boost/ mid vol),A-/A,A+,Kinda Worth it,"Cleaner Harman 2019 with less sub-bass and more air. Good tech, but can be a bit clinical, and doesn't scale as well/not as musical as stock switch."

Immersive with scaling, but not the best value - Less technical than HEXA & Cinno. A warmer Cinno basically, and a warmer mini Volume S. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,AFUL Explorer ($119) 💖,A+,B+,Worth it (HIGH-VOL),"High volume set, very immersive, scales great with no sharpness, wide staging, enough detail/extension, good bass, just crank it up and enjoy the music."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,LETSHUOER x AOSHIDA E20 EQ ($50) 🌟🌟💖,A+,B+,GOOD VALUE,"BASS EQ VERSION. 2DD setup like Deuce but with a 10mm Berylium DD. Slight step-up in resolution, staging, and detail over the Deuce. Deuce bass still goes deeper, harder, and fuller with more reverb (better as basshead).               EQ: (Peak 20hz, +2.5db, Q:2), (Peak 35hz, +7db, Q:0.5), (Peak 40hz, -1db, Q:1.3), (Peak 120hz, +1.5db, Q:1), (Low-shelf 150hz, +1.5db, Q:1), (Peak 320hz, -1db, Q:2), (Peak 1500hz, -1.5db, Q:1). "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,FATFREQ HBB DEUCE ($259) 💖,A+,B+,Worth it,"The defacto basshead rec before the more expensive stuff. Super fun sub-bass, textured, heavy, prolonged decay for more reverb in the bass, well-balanced as well, smooth and scales great. Tech is not its strong point, and DON'T buy from FatFreq directly!!!"
NEW (MID-VOLUME),A-,6,7Hz Crinacle Diablo ($150),A+,B+,Wait for Sale,"Bassy, dynamic, non-fatiguing, good scaling. Great bass slam, texture, with tight control. Fun lowkey basshead set. Might be too warm and congested for vocals/instrumentals. Priced $50 higher than I'd like."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,SIMGOT EW300 DSP with 3.5/4.4 cable ($80) 🌟,A/A+,A-,Good Value ,"Swapping the DSP cable to a 3.5/4.4mm will give you basically the same sound as stock 3.5mm EW300, so you end up getting 4 different tunings if you have a spare cable lying around. Nice."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,SIMGOT EW300 3.5MM ($70) 🌟,A/A+,A-,Good Value ,A smoother and more refined version of the EW200 with better layering and resolution bump. Pink nozzle is warmer and better for rock/hiphop/metal. Very good piezo implementation.
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Heartfield CU8 ($279),A/A+,A-,Wait for Sale,Warmer Harman 2019 with less shouty vocals. Bassy all-rounder with decent tech. Build and plate design is very pretty... but price is a bit high and not that competitive - wait for sale unless you really dig the look.
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,Symphonium Giant ($699) ,A/A+,B+,Kinda Worth it,"Super warm and thick, mid-bass centric, basically the Meteor with less treble and more low-end, needs power, turns into basshead at higher volumes, very bassy."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,7th Acoustic Stargazer (disc) ,A,A-/A,Worth it,"A mini supernova with better sub-bass extension, but not as smooth, airy, and ""technical"". Probably still one of the best all-rounders around $100."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,LETSHUOER S12 2024 $199,A,A-/A,Worth it,"The most refined S12 to date. Smoothest treble out of all the S12, and very little Planar timbre while keeping up the great tech and detail."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,Tanchjim KARA ($179) ,A,A-,Worth it,Clean and natural midrange focused signature that's right up my alley. Open and airy staging with great instrument layering. Still very resolving even though it lacks the last bit of treble detail. Very smooth dynamics but could use more sub-bass.
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Juzear x Zeos Defiant ($99),A,A-,Kinda Worth it,"Another all-rounder with good balance. Doesn't do anything right or wrong, but has qc issues with channel imbalance (and also my case ziper broke within a few weeks), it's ok but there are better value out there."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,ZIIGAAT CINNO ($100)  $70 on sale,A,A-,Worth it,"Good intrument separation/layering, but feels like the music is cut into certain areas in the stage and not harmonious (UPDATE: tip rolling helped, the fit was a little weird like the OG Dark Magician). Resolution is good, but isn't that clear and can be a little bit dark at mid-lower volumes, but the FR highlights guitars/insturments very well. Sub-bass is also good, but mid-bass feels light like the Hexa. Another neutral set like the Hexa but with better sub-bass, less gain, better scaling, although at the cost of darker treble. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Tanchjim Oxygen 02 ($240) ,A,A-,Kinda Worth it,Amazing tuning and tech. A more resolving Hana. Great imaging but not as 3D as Tea. Fit may be a little shallow.
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,HISENIOR MEGA5P ULTRA ($240),A,A-,Kinda Worth it,"A mini EJ07M with more forward vocals and less technical, good all-rounder, vocals can be a bit much at higher volume"
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,AFUL Performer 5 ($219) ,A,A-,Kinda Worth it,"Fun slight v-shape tuning with forward vocals with slight excitement in the treble. Separation takes a hit as a result, and treble is a bit uneven. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Tanchjim 4U ($69),A,B+/A-,Worth it,Solid IEM. Warm to neutral depending on the switch. Overall pretty smooth with good tech. 
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,ARTTI T10 PRO $95,A,B+/A-,Worth it,"A mini symphonium Meteor. Bassy, warm, and airy/smooth. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,NICEHCK NX8 $200,A,B+/A-,Kinda Worth it,An Explorer with better vocals but doesn't scale as well. Odyssey and Arcadia better for clean and bass sound. 
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,AFUL Magic One ($139) $70 on sale,A,B+/A-,Kinda Worth it,"Balanced and neutral with slight warmth in the mid-bass. Male vocals are great on these, weighted but still has edge and sharpness to the end notes, but can get sharp at higher volumes. Male vocals are bit congested, not the most open need the right tips (CLARION). Stage is average, and treble is smooth with solid extension for the most part, tech is around Hexa/EM6L level which is great for a single BA. Great neutral-warm/all-rounder overall, it's pretty much an adjusted diffuse-field with more mid-bass. I personally don't get the hype/""magic"" behind these. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Tangzu HBB Xuan NV ($79) ,A,B+/A-,Worth it,"A smoother hexa, and mini-nova. Very clean and balanced all-rounder. Good vocal set. Harman 2019 with more mid-bass, less uppermids and sub-bass. Nothing crazy, but does every genre very well."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Moondrop Aria 2 RED $100,A,B+/A-,Kinda Worth it,"A slightly more vocal centric Aria 2, slightly less soft in the overall texture due to less air. Balanced-clean all-rounder. A bit pricy at $100, wait for sale."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Apevoix Grit ($229),A,B+/A-,Eh,"A better tuned Anvil, but BCD doesn't do much, bassy all-rounder sound"
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,Penon DOME ($350) ,A,B+/A-,Eh,"Warm, intimate sound without being too bassy and bloated. Vocals are forward and very immersive. Resolution not that competitive, but a very musical set. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,FATfreq Maestro Mini ($482),A,B+/A-,Eh,"A basshead set that's actually well-balanced for the most part. Extension on uppermids/highs are good but can get shouty, sub-bass texture and slam is impactful and satisfying - this is the set for most bassheads who don't want a crap ton of bass but still a good amount. Deuce better."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,INTUARA SPLENDOR VIEW 2 ($259),A,B+/A-,Eh,"Slight v-shape that's well done. Well-rounded, nothing much wrong with it. Good all-rounder. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Juzear 61t ($220),A,B+/A-,Eh,"Low-end is good, tight, with good impact, but bass feels low-res. Vocals are too recessed and warm. Treble and air is good, but that's about it. BA timbre. Relaxing listen, but Dynaquattro is just the better version of it imo, better bass texture, clarity, vocals. Too much competition around it."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Moondrop Kadenz ($189),A,B+/A-,Eh,"Literally a more fancy Tangzu Xuan NV. Sounds basically the same but just with better packaging, cable/case, and build... but for $100 more?? Nah"
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,FATfreq Scarlet Mini ($643),A,B+/A-,Eh,"Crap ton of sub-bass but still very well-controlled (for the most part). No mud or mid-bass bloat, uppermids/treble are smoother than Maestro Mini, still somewhat balanced without having the low-end overtake. Vocals do distort sometimes as the sub-bass can bleed into it. Deuce better."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,BQEYZ Winter ($239) ,A,B+/A-,Kinda Worth it,"Clean and open signature with slight treble emphasis. Not airy, but more sharp. Great resolution and imaging. Relatively safe tuning. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,ORIVERTI OD200 ($200),A,B+,Kinda Worth it,"A warmer EA1000 with less treble energy. Treble quality is great, smooth, refined with Silver nozzle. Black nozzle too spicy."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,SIMGOT EW300 DSP ($80) ,A,B+,Worth it,"A mini Dynaquattro, clean, balanced, vocal focused versus the 3.5mm version. Scales very good and smoothly with pink nozzles. Slight hit in imaging and transients vs 3.5mm version."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Tripowin HBB Olina SE (disc) ,A,B+,Worth it,Cheapest holographic staging you can get. Very smooth overall with little uneveness. Double Olina filter mod (or SE version) fixes the uppermid and treble brightness from OG while maintaining technicalities. Smoother and better fit than Airship. Get it on sale. 
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Kiwi Ears Melody ($89)  ,A-/A,A-/A,Worth it,"Fun signature done right. Sparkly and energetic V-SHAPE, but with punchy bass and not bloated for under $100 - how? Can get a bit sharp with certain tracks."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,EPZ x Tipsy STAR ONE ($80) ,A-/A,B+,Worth it,"Vocal focused set. Female vocals are sweet and clean with subtly air and sparkle. Treble and bass is decent, does the job. Harman but with a twist."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Shozy P20 ($139) $70 on sale,A-/A,B+,Kinda Worth it,"T10 PRO better. Unique tuning with ""speical sauce"", warm but also sparkly in the treble without the uppermids becoming shouty (tamer uppermids). Great for kpop/jpop/pop and even hiphop and rock. Gives you that splashy ocd feeling in the treble but also still warm. Timbre is decent, not as offensive as the other planars. Vocal details/texture does take a step back as a trade off for less shout."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,LETSHUOER S08 ($99) ,A-/A,B+,Worth it,"More uniquely tuned than other planars. Tamer uppermids, not as energetic, but still with great bass separation and tech. Timbre is good."
(HIGH-VOLUME),A-,6,Softear Studio 2 ($169),A-/A,B+,Quirky,"HIGH VOLUME SET (at least 75dbs+). Warm, comfy, vintage-like sound with great immersion. Vocals are somehow still clear at higher volume and not overly dark. Not very good tech to $$ value wise, but very unique sounding. Would not recommend for mid to lower volume listening as it'll sound too dark, congested, and ""low-res"". Needs scaling. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,FlipEars AEGIS ($479) ,A-,A,Eh,"Slight v-shape, but with less bass and low-end texture than Legion, more ""balanced"" and less engaging, but my unit was shouty and a bit sharp in the uppermids, also costs alot for what you can get at under $100. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Kiwi Ears CANTA ($89) ,A-,A,Genre Specific ,"Bright set with lots of treble detail. Airy, splashy, and shimmery with great extension. Isn't sharp or metallic in the timbre, but not 100% ""natural"" either, comes down to preference. Mid-volume set, good with slower genres, not rec for high energy tracks, can get much at higher volumes. Favors female vocals, male could be a bit light and could use more power, but vocals aren't thin or shrill sounding like the Oracle MK2s. Not gonna float everyone's boat, but it's a unique listen (not the same planar tuning yay) and worth having as a collectors piece."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,LETSHUOER S12 PRO ($135) ,A-,A,Kinda Worth it,A less bright timeless/S12.
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,NICEHCK F1 PRO ($99) ,A-,A,Good Value ,A cheaper S12. Almost identical sound and tuning. Good value. Look for aliexpress deals.

(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,7Hz Timeless ($220)  Outdated unless sale,A-,A,Kinda Worth it,"Great details. Good stage in front but lacking in wideness/3D. Imaging is good and speration is great, but uneven treble peaks. Planar timbre. Vocals and notes can be thin. Fatiguing at higher volume listening. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Simgot EA2000 ($320),A-,A,Eh,"Very clean with great resolution, but vocals can be too bright (alot of gain). Bass-texture is great with decent treble extension. Amazing for female vocals, but again, can get shouty. A brighter EA1000."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,ARTTI T10 ($50) 🌟🌟🌟 $50 lowest,A-,A-,GREAT VALUE,A cheaper S12. Almost identical sound and tuning. INSANE value. Look for aliexpress deals. 
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,TINHIFI DUDU ($80) ,A-,A-,Worth it,"Least planar, almost doesn't sound like one. 3K gain can be a bit much, tech very similar as the other ones."
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,Truthears HEXA (FOAM tips) ($80) ,A-,A-,Good Value ,"Foam helps tame uppermids/treble. Amazing detail for price and new benchmark below $100. Better tuned ""softer"" Dusk with slighlty less accurate imaging. Note-weight can be light. "
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,PULA Anvil ($199),A-,A-,Eh,"Good low-end impact and slam, but boomy/soft in the bass texture, the BCD has no effect in the low-end, more prominent in the uppermids/treble which can lead to some sharp/graininess/jaggity timbre. Feels like they tried to copy the Tea Pros but failed, worse in both tuning and driver quality - I'd just get the D62 or save up for the Tea Pros"
(MID-VOLUME),A-,6,SIVGA Nightingale ($279) ,B,A+,Eh,"If you get a boosted treble unit then it'd be ranked here...VERY GENRE SPECIFIC. Listen at high volume with slower tracks (slow rock, ballads, indie, jazz, blues, acoustics, instrumentals etc). TOTL stage, layering, treble detail, but vocals and sub-bass are rolled-off/pushed back, losing details there otherwise would be at least be S- for tech. Treble can also be too energetic depending on the unit (a lot of them graph with lots of treble - mine doesn't sound that boosted), so in-general NOT RECOMMENDED for libraries with a lot of sub-bass (rolled-off) or energy (too sharp if you get a boosted unit). That aside, gives me OG EJ07 vibes immersion wise. Hard to recommend because unit variations. "
,OK,,,,,,
(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,Truthear Crinacle Blue 2 ($65) 5ohm adapter,A,B,Worth it,"Mini HBB Punch. Fun basshead sound with impedance adapter. Extra bass helps balance out the uppermids/treble, making it more enjoyable than stock. "

(HIGH-VOLUME),B+,5.5,Apple AirPods Pro 2 ($250) ,A-,B+,Worth it,"Great sense of depth with improvement in soundstage over OG. More precise imaging, and improvement in seperation and overall clarity. Treble is better exteded. Sub-bass is around the same with more mid-bass. Vocals are more pushed back vs OG. Overall welcomed improvements."
(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,Kefine Delci AE ($69),A-,B+,Worth it,"A smoother EW200 with the silver nozzles (although vocals are better on the EW200). Bronze nozzle can be too bright and peaky, but brings up the technacilities"

(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,Tripowin HBB Kailua ($30)  $30 on sale,A-,B+,Worth it,"Great all-rounder. A more exciting Olina SE with bump in sharpness and bass texture (Olina SE still more 3D). Driver feels fast and detailed. Sweet female vocals and treble extension. Nice bass slam. DD timbre. No real complaints - open stage although hurt by masking which can feel like there's ""holes""; masking also affects female vocals (not completely extended), but very resolving for its price, although can use better separation. "
(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,DUNU Titan S2 ($79),A-,B+,Kinda Worth it,"Very nice built and cable for the price. Sounds like a warm harman. Tech is good, but not too competitive at the price (EA500LM)."

(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,BQEYZ WIND ($200),B+,A-,Eh,"Bright-neutral with sharp transients. If you like treble you'll like this. Bass texture is solid, reminds me of the EA1000s. Not that smooth, slightly energetic/lively sound. "
(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,EPZ K5 ($105),B+,A-,Eh,"Clean, uppermids focused with slight scope at 500hz that can make it sound clinical and sharp in female vocals, however, great resolution and great for acoustic instrumentals. "

(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro ($230),B+,B+,Worth it,"Very well tuned with slight v-shape. Bass is detailed with good texture and treble has good extension. Soundstage is average and lacks width; less open and expansive than AirPods Pro 2s. Imaging and separation is also good but slightly behind the AP2. Vocals and treble are more forward with more bite vs AP2. More exciting vs the AP2 that's more balanced and laid back. Detail and clarity are similar vs AP2, but treble and bass is more emphasized and takes more of one's focus. "
(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,LETSHUOER x AOSHIDA E20 ($50),B+,B+,Worth it,"Stock non-EQ. Clean, balanced tuning with nice bass texture. Could use more body in the low-end and fill in the mid-bass scoop, or less uppermids. Good tech"

(MID-VOLUME),B+,5.5,Tripowin x Olina OG (disc) ,B+,B+,Kinda Worth it,"Bright Oxygen with deeper fit+more treble air results in better soundstage. Great for mid volume, but fatiguing vocals and treble at higher volume. Mod needed for higher volume/longer listening. "

(MID-VOLUME),B,5,Sennheiser IE200 ($150),B,B+,Kinda Worth it,"Great dynamics and scaling. Very good treble timbre and extension... but $150?? Low-end is soft, boring, and pushed back. Mid-range and vocals are recessed. Same level of clarity and tech as cheaper sets like DSP and Khan. Gets outdoned by the Hexa, Olina, Dioko for $50-70 cheaper. Horrible pricing. NEEDS EQ or MOD. "

(MID-VOLUME),S- ,,XENNS TOP (Modded) ($530) 💎,S- ,A+/S-,Worth it,"300 Mesh Filter allows it to scale at higher volumes and is smoother overall. Even though the nozzle is bigger than the filter, the hole in the nozzle is actually the right size for the filter, so just aim correctly and you're good to go!"
(HIGH-VOLUME),A+,,Simgot EA1000 ($220) 💖,S- ,A/A+,Worth it,"Gold nozzle+500 mesh filter+deep wide tips= close to perfection. Ranking is only relevant in context with specific genres like ballads, slow-rock, acousitcs, and indie. "

(HIGH-VOLUME),B+,,Tanchjim Hana 2021 Modded (disc) 💖,A,B,Kinda Worth it,"Amazing bass set when modded, but slightly worse resolution/separation than Olina. Much better note-weight, low-end rumble, and slam than modded Olina/Airship. Low-end is super immersive at high-volume."
(MID-VOLUME),B+,,Sennheiser IE200 (EQ) ($150),A-,B+,Worth it,"A +3db at 50hz 0.1 Q,  +1 db at 2500hz 3Q, +1db 3000hz 1 Q fixes soft bass, and drastically impoves midrange and vocal clarity. Actually competitive now. One of the best treble extension and dynamics (around its price category) now without an anemic low-end and recessed mids to drag it down. "
(HIGH-VOLUME),B,,Apple AirPods Pro (EQ) ($250) outdated dont buy,A-,B-,Eh,Better soundstage and clarity due to tweak to high and low-end extension. Vocals are more engaging as well.

(MID-VOLUME),B-,,7hz Salnotes Zero Modded ($20),B+,C,Eh,"Incredibly tuned IEM. Natural vocals and decent treble extension but not overdone like the Chu, Olina, or Dusk; vocals are more laid back instead of forward. Imaging is average and soundstage needs width/more 3D but not a complaint at $20. Mod: Add filter on top - the thicker the filter the more bass and less uppermids/treble. "
(MID-VOLUME),B-,,Moondrop Chu Modded ($20) outdated dont buy,B+,C,Eh,Not as technicial as Starfield/Aria but more enjoyable tuning. Double filter mod and bass tips improves bass and smoothens out mid-high frequencies and treble for louder/longer listening.

(MID-VOLUME),B-,,Tanchjim Zero Modded ($20) outdated dont buy,B+,C,Eh,"Super clean, neutral, and smooth dynamics.

EARBUD (relative to IEM rank) ,,,,,,,
(HIGH-VOLUME),A,,TGXear SERRATUS ($200)💖💎,S-,A-,Worth it,"One of the best timbre and coherency I've ever heard. Everything sounds like real life. Perfect note-weight. HUGE soundstage with excellent height, width and depth, even wider than EJ and DM. Thumping low-end makesyour ears rumble. Vocals are powerful, but could be more open, and can be a bit warm with some songs. Centre-stage imaging with decent separation. Could use more treble air extension, and better separation. Also needs a lot of powa (300ohms), and fit may be an issue. Otherwise HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
(HIGH-VOLUME),B,,RikuBuds - Grand Rider 1 (100 Euros) ,A-,B-,Kinda Worth it,"Great low-end, punchy and textured. Full sounding signature in general. A set that you should crank UP. Soundstage is more depth than wide. Very good with hiphop/R&B/Pop. Vocals are a bit muffled. Treble roll off removes details. Imaging and separation is average. Doesn't fit my ears unfortunately. Very fun and thick overall, just wish it had more clarity with better separation and imaging. This would be amazing as a hybrid or tri-bird using the same DD. Recommended EQ: High-shelf 2000Hz +3db/High-shelf 10KHz +2db both with Q-factor 1"
