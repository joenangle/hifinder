### IEMs (5 components)
1. **Audeze Euclid** - 18mm planar IEM, first closed-back planar from Audeze
2. **A&K T8iE** - Dynamic driver IEM with Tesla technology
3. **Audiosense DT200** - 2 BA driver IEM
4. **Audiosense DT600** - 6 BA driver IEM
5. **Meze Rai Penta** - Hybrid IEM (4BA + 1DD)

### Cans (6 components)
1. **BLON B20** - Planar magnetic over-ear, 97x76mm drivers, 460g
2. **Final D8000 Pro** - AFDS planar over-ear, 523g
3. **Moondrop Para** - 100mm planar over-ear, 530g
4. **Moondrop Void** - 50mm dynamic over-ear, 250g
5. **Stax SR-Lambda Pro** - Electrostatic over-ear (requires special amp)
6. **Symphonium HarmonicDyne Helios** - 50mm dynamic over-ear, 360g

## Technical Specifications Added

All 13 components received comprehensive technical data:

| Component | Impedance | Driver Type | Needs Amp | Fit Type |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Audeze LCD-XC | 20Ω | Planar | No* | Closed Circumaural |
| Audeze Euclid | 12Ω | Planar | No | Universal |
| A&K T8iE | 16Ω | Dynamic | No | Universal |
| Audiosense DT200 | 14Ω | BA | No | Universal |
| Audiosense DT600 | 16Ω | BA | No | Universal |
| Hifiman HE500 | 38Ω | Planar | Yes | Open Circumaural |
| Meze Rai Penta | 20Ω | Hybrid | No | Universal |
| BLON B20 | 32Ω | Planar | Yes | Open Circumaural |
| Final D8000 Pro | 60Ω | Planar | Yes | Semi-Open Circumaural |
| Moondrop Para | 8Ω | Planar | Yes** | Open Circumaural |
| Moondrop Void | 64Ω | Dynamic | No | Open Circumaural |
| Stax SR-Lambda Pro | N/A*** | Electrostatic | Yes*** | Open Circumaural |
| HarmonicDyne Helios | 16Ω | Dynamic | No | Open Circumaural |

\* Benefits from amplification despite being drivable by portables
\** Requires HIGH CURRENT amplification (up to 1A peaks) - see critical notes
\*** Requires dedicated electrostatic amplifier/energizer, not standard headphone amp

## Critical Notes for Implementation

### 1. Moondrop Para (8Ω) - High Current Requirement
- **Sensitivity:** 101dB/Vrms (equivalent to 80dB/mW)
- **Current Draw:** Up to 1 ampere for 120dB peaks
- **Incompatible With:** Most dongles, basic DAPs, entry-level amps
- **Requires:** Desktop amplifier or powerful DAP with current drive capability
- **Recommended Amps:** Schiit Jotunheim 2, A70pro, Schiit Unity

### 2. Stax SR-Lambda Pro - Electrostatic Special Requirements
- **Bias Voltage:** 580VDC (pro-bias)
- **Cannot Use:** Standard headphone amplifiers or outputs
- **Requires:** Dedicated electrostatic amplifier/energizer
- **Connection:** 5-pin proprietary connector
- **Age:** Vintage model (released 1982)

### 3. Brand Name Issue: "Symphonium HarmonicDyne Helios"
- **Issue:** Brand listed as "Symphonium HarmonicDyne" appears incorrect
- **Likely Correct:** "HarmonicDyne" (manufacturer of Helios headphones)
- **Note:** Symphonium Helios is a completely different product (4BA IEM, $1,100)
- **Recommendation:** Verify database entry - may need brand name correction

### 4. Planar Amplification General Note
Several planar headphones (HE500, B20, D8000 Pro, Para) require dedicated amplification despite moderate impedance due to low sensitivity and current demands.
