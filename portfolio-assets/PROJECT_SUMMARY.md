# HiFinder - One-Page Portfolio Summary

## 🎯 The Challenge
Help audiophile enthusiasts navigate 560+ headphones, DACs, and amplifiers without overwhelming newcomers or boring experts.

## 💡 The Solution
An AI-powered recommendation engine that adapts complexity to user experience level, built in collaboration with Claude AI over 8 weeks.

## 📊 Impact Metrics

### Performance Improvements
- **90% faster authentication** (2000ms → <200ms)
- **27% faster builds** through code splitting
- **25% more space efficiency** in UI layout
- **Zero TypeScript errors** in last 6 weeks of development

### Product Scale
- **297 production commits** in 8 weeks
- **560 audio components** with expert ratings
- **179 used listings** auto-scraped weekly
- **3 experience modes** (Beginner, Intermediate, Enthusiast)

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Recommendation Engine
- Beginners see 3 simple options
- Intermediates see 5-8 balanced choices with champion callouts
- Enthusiasts access full technical specs and expert data

### 2. Dual-Layer Sound Signature System
- **Layer 1:** 4 basic categories (Neutral, Warm, Bright, Fun) for 560 components
- **Layer 2:** 20+ expert signatures for 398 components (e.g., "Bright neutral", "Mild V-shape")
- Null-safe bonus scoring (missing data doesn't penalize)

### 3. Smart Budget System
- Dual-range slider (±10% to ±35% flexibility)
- Automatic allocation across headphone + DAC/amp systems
- Strong preference for budget utilization (45% weight in scoring)

### 4. Contextual Used Listings
- Filter by selected items only
- Auto-scraped from Reddit r/AVexchange
- Fuzzy matching for inconsistent product names

## 🛠️ Technical Innovations

### Recommendation Algorithm
```
matchScore = (priceFit × 45%) + (soundMatch × 45%) + (expertBonus × 10%)
```
Evolved through 3 iterations to eliminate >100% scores and underbudget bias.

### CI/CD Automation
Fully automated staging deployment pipeline after 16 commits learning "simple first":
- Push to staging → GitHub Actions triggers
- Wait for Vercel deployment ready
- Auto-update staging.hifinder.app alias
- Zero human intervention, 0% error rate

### Fuzzy Data Matching
Levenshtein distance (≥0.8 similarity) for CSV imports:
- Handles multi-word brands ("Audio Technica", "Ultimate Ears")
- Dry-run → execute safety pattern
- Corrected 1,200+ raw entries → 560 accurate components

## 🤝 Human-AI Collaboration Insights

### What I Provided
- Domain knowledge (audiophile market understanding)
- User empathy ("this feels wrong" → algorithmic fixes)
- Design direction and UX philosophy
- Problem identification and prioritization

### What Claude Provided
- Implementation patterns and code structure
- Algorithm optimization and edge case handling
- Performance profiling and suggestions
- Proactive tooling recommendations (pre-push hooks, etc.)

### Key Learning: "Simple First"
The staging automation saga (16 commits) taught me to always ask **"What does the platform give us for free?"** before building custom solutions. Vercel's automatic git-branch aliases eliminated 60 lines of complex parsing code.

## 📈 Development Velocity

- **Average:** 5-6 commits per day
- **Bug fixes:** <30 minute turnaround
- **Features:** 3-5 days concept → production
- **Iteration cycle:** Ship → Measure → Learn → Repeat

## 🎨 UX Philosophy Evolution

Started with expansive, generous spacing. User observation + AI efficiency suggestions led to iterative compression:
- Card headers: `px-6 py-4` → `px-4 py-3`
- Item spacing: `space-y-3` → `space-y-2`
- Typography: `heading-3` → `text-lg font-semibold`

**Result:** 20-25% more vertical density without sacrificing readability.

## 🚀 What's Next

### Q1 2026: Enhanced Discovery
- Progressive signature disclosure (expandable categories)
- Visual 2D signature map (warm↔bright × laid-back↔energetic)
- Summit-fi expansion (20-30 high-end components)

### Q2 2026: Community Features
- Verified user reviews
- Stack sharing ("Share your audio setup")
- Price drop alerts

### Q3 2026: Monetization
- eBay Partner Network affiliate integration
- Transparent sponsored recommendations
- Premium features (advanced filtering, unlimited saved stacks)

## 🏆 Key Achievements

1. **Built production-ready product** in 8 weeks with AI collaboration
2. **Shipped 297 commits** demonstrating iterative development velocity
3. **Achieved measurable performance gains** (90% auth, 27% build speed)
4. **Designed for accessibility** across beginner → expert experience levels
5. **Established reusable patterns** (fuzzy matching, dual-layer data, CI/CD)
