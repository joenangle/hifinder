## onboarding/
- **Archived:** October 29, 2025
- **Reason:** Replaced by guided tooltips on recommendations page
- **Original Purpose:** Multi-step onboarding flow for new users to configure preferences (experience level, budget, headphone type, sound signature)

## onboarding-v2/
- **Archived:** October 29, 2025
- **Reason:** Replaced by guided tooltips on recommendations page (V2 was also superseded before active use)
- **Original Purpose:** Simplified onboarding flow iteration

Both onboarding flows have been eliminated in favor of a direct-to-recommendations approach with inline guided tooltips to reduce friction in the user experience.
